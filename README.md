# Download AIO

Streamlined media downloader tool built with [Sveltekit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), [shadcn-svelte](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte), and [youtube-dl-exec](https://github.com/microlinkhq/youtube-dl-exec)

## Todo

- Check other sites other than YouTube to see if they're working
- Add frontend progress bar
